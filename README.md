# kucoin-buyer

scripts which allow buying newly listed Tokens on Kucoin as soon as they are released, as well as buying tokens as soon as they have been announced to pump (by scraping a Telegram OR Discord pump channel's announcment)

## ðŸ“š Notes 

- In order to place sell orders instantaneously after buy order fulfilled, press pg-up to place limit sell order on highest bid order, or pg-down to place market sell order. Note that Market selling guarantees your sell order will go through 

- For pumps, the announcment message must contain a link to the announced token.<br/>
example message: " The token to pump is BTC - https://trade.kucoin.com/BTC-USDT "

## ðŸ’– Made profit? Show support! 
During the development of this project I envisioned that I would monotize it, However, due to my love for open-source, I've decided to share this application free of charge.  If it has been useful to you, it would go a great way to show your support.
