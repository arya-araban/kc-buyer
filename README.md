# kucoin-buyer

A script which allows buying newly listed Tokens on Kucoin as soon as they are released.

There is also another script which buys tokens as soon as they have been announced to pump (by scraping a Telegram OR Discord pump channel's announcment)

## ðŸ“š Notes 
- For pumps, the announcment message must contain a link to the announced token.<br/>
example message: " The token to pump is BTC - https://trade.kucoin.com/BTC-USDT "

## ðŸ’– Made profit? Show support! 
During the development of this project I envisioned that I would monotize it, However, due to my love to open-source, I've decided to share this application free of charge.  If it has been useful to you, it would go a great way to show your support.
